In order to make sure that you have the most recent and accurate list of Jewelry, this app utilizes in-app purchases to update the database when a new catalog comes out. Data updates for the Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer collections are an additional fee.

The Christmas catalog update is FREE. Once the new catalog is released, we will do our best to get the database updated as quickly as possible and it is generally complete before Rally is over! Your app will prompt you to purchase the updated data when it is available. Updates will be $4.99 each.

#### Note: 

The Show Closer is an app written specifically for independent distributors of [Premier Designs high fashion jewelry](http://www.premierdesigns.com/). _This app is useless for anyone else!_ (unless you're looking at the code to learn about RubyMotion)

## Download from the App Store

[![image](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.gif)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/show-closer/id483940964?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4yY&ct=github)

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`
3. Run `rake pod:install`
4. Run `RUBYMOTION_TESTER=true rake` (the first part is VERY critical - it will bypass the identification checks so that you can check out the app without being an independent distributor)
5. The simulator should launch automatically.
